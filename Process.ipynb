      "Through kaggle.com, we participated in predictive stock price modeling competition in the hack/reduce space at the Boston Data Festival, sponsored by DataRobot. Our challenge was to predict whether a stock would go up or down on a particular day, given the stock's pricing data from the 10 days prior. After experimenting with various models and attempting to blend models, we eventually reached 94.119% accuracy with our predictions. In the end, we won 1st place in the competition. Through this engaging and rewarding experience with predictive stock price modeling, we became very excited about the real-world applications of this kind of model and wanted to go more in depth into our predictive analysis after the hackathon. Our CS109 final project gave us a structured opportunity to extend our work on this model. Overall, our project goals were: \n",
